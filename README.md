This was template we used during Resilient Coders to understand Express and MongoDB


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node, EJS, MongoDb


## Lessons Learned:

- How to create a server with Express
- How to manage a database with MongoDB
- How to use Node modules
- CSS would need to be improved, right now it is very plain and basic.
- There is potential to make a better app that can let users save books they want to read in the future. A text file is saved with potential code but will need further research
